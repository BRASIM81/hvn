<p>I have been a nail technician/beautician for 14 years. I was lucky enough to undertake my training at the prestigious Creative Nail Designs in Kent and to further my knowledge and ensure my clients get the best care and to keep my knowledge up to date, I also have recently attended the award winning Katie Barnes Academy on several occasions.</p>
